        <h2>My First Semester at BCIT</h2>
            <p>Hello, welcome to my website! my name is Jordan, and I am a student at BCIT Downtown campus. 
        I am currently enrolled in the Computer Information Technology (CIT) program. I have a BA in Philosophy from the University of British Columbia and a 
    grad certificate in Cybercrime Intelligence Analysis from the Justice Institute of British Columbia. I intend to use my CIT Diploma to enter the cybersecurity workforce. </p>

        web technologies, organizational behavior and systems administration.</p>
